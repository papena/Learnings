Creational:
-----------------
Abstract Factory----created objects of families of the classes
Factory method--hides the complexity of creation of the objects and created the objects of the derived classes
Singleton--created a single instance

Structural
-------------
Adapter--makes two incompatible  classes  compatible
Bridge--Decouples abstraction from the implementation so that both can vary independently.
or 
Bridge pattern seperates abstraction and implememtation classes so that both can be modified together with out impact.
Facade---provied unifed interface for a set of subsystems

Behavioural
------------------
Chain of Responsibility---lets you to pass a request to chain of receivers which eiher one can handle and process the request.
Iterator---one should access the object by looping through the collection by hiding the manipulative methods.
Observer--is also called as pub-sub model where observer listens to the subject. any change in the subject should be  updated to the observers.
Template method:---
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
